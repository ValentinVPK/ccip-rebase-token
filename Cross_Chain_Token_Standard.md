# Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard

## Technical Overview

The Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard is a protocol specification that enables tokens to maintain consistent functionality, state, and identity across multiple blockchain networks. Unlike traditional bridging solutions that focus on moving tokens between chains, CCT defines a comprehensive framework for creating truly blockchain-agnostic tokens with unified liquidity and governance.

## Core Principles

The CCT Standard is built on five fundamental principles:

1. **Token Identity Preservation**: A token maintains the same identity across all supported chains
2. **Unified Supply Control**: Total token supply is managed holistically across all deployments
3. **Consistent Functionality**: Core token features work identically regardless of blockchain
4. **Native User Experience**: Users interact with tokens using native chain mechanics
5. **Chain Abstraction**: Applications can interact with tokens without blockchain-specific logic

## Architecture Components

### 1. Token Contract Layer

Each blockchain hosts a token contract that conforms to:

- The native token standard of that chain (e.g., ERC-20 on Ethereum, SPL on Solana)
- CCT extension interfaces for cross-chain messaging
- Supply management mechanics

### 2. Bridge Infrastructure Layer

A network of bridge contracts and off-chain validators that:

- Facilitate cross-chain token transfers
- Synchronize token metadata and state
- Manage global token supply

### 3. Messaging Protocol Layer

The interconnection mechanism that enables:

- Token movement instructions
- State synchronization messages
- Supply reconciliation signals

### 4. Minting and Burning Controls

Specialized logic that:

- Enforces global supply invariants
- Manages authorized minting/burning rights
- Prevents double-spending across chains

## Token Supply Management

CCT tokens use one of three models for managing cross-chain supply:

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke Model

This approach designates one blockchain as the "canonical" or "hub" chain:

- The hub chain maintains the authoritative supply record
- Secondary (spoke) chains maintain representations of the token
- When tokens move to a spoke chain, they are locked on the hub
- When tokens return to the hub, they are released
- Supply is always fully accounted for between hub lockups and spoke issuances

**Example**: A CCT token with Ethereum as its hub might lock 100 tokens in an Ethereum contract to issue 100 tokens on Polygon, with the total supply on Ethereum showing the sum of circulating and locked tokens.

### 2. Multi-Canonical Model

This more sophisticated approach treats multiple chains as equal authorities:

- Each chain maintains its own supply pool
- Cross-chain transfers reduce supply on the source chain and increase it on the destination
- A global consensus mechanism tracks total supply across all chains
- Smart contracts or governance processes can rebalance supply between chains

**Example**: A CCT token might have 1,000 tokens authorized for Ethereum and 500 for Avalanche. If demand shifts, governance could vote to move 200 units of authorized supply from Ethereum to Avalanche.

### 3. Burn-and-Mint Model

This approach eliminates locked tokens entirely:

- Tokens are burned on the source chain when transferred
- Equivalent tokens are minted on the destination chain
- Total supply is calculated as the sum across all chains
- Each chain maintains a registry of burns and mints

**Example**: When transferring 50 tokens from Arbitrum to Optimism, the tokens are burned on Arbitrum and a message is sent to mint 50 on Optimism, with both operations recorded in their respective registries.

## Token Transfer Flow

When a CCT token moves between chains, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Initiation**:

   - User requests a transfer from Chain A to Chain B
   - Source chain contract verifies the request's validity
   - Transfer parameters are encoded in a cross-chain message

2. **Source Chain Operations**:

   - Depending on the supply model, tokens are either:
     - Locked in a vault contract
     - Burned with a burn receipt issued
   - Source chain supply is adjusted accordingly
   - Transfer event is emitted with cross-chain identifiers

3. **Cross-Chain Verification**:

   - Bridge validators confirm the source chain transaction
   - Proof of valid transfer is generated
   - Message is transmitted to the destination chain

4. **Destination Chain Operations**:

   - Target chain contract validates the incoming message
   - Tokens are minted or released from escrow
   - Destination address receives the tokens
   - Transfer completion event is emitted

5. **State Reconciliation**:
   - Global supply registries are updated
   - Transfer is marked as completed
   - Liquidity indices are adjusted if necessary

## Advanced Features

### 1. Cross-Chain Messaging for Token Functions

CCT tokens can implement extended functionality:

- **Cross-Chain Approvals**: Approve spending on a remote chain
- **Delegated Transfers**: Allow third parties to initiate transfers
- **Transfer Hooks**: Execute custom logic when tokens move chains

Example implementation:

```solidity
function approveOnChain(
    uint64 targetChain,
    address spender,
    uint256 amount
) external returns (bytes32 messageId) {
    // Send approval instruction to target chain
    return _sendCrossChainMessage(
        targetChain,
        abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "receiveApproval(address,address,uint256)",
            msg.sender,
            spender,
            amount
        )
    );
}
```

### 2. Token Metadata Synchronization

CCT tokens maintain consistent metadata across chains:

- **Name and Symbol**: Automatically synchronized across deployments
- **Token Information**: Decimals, icons, and descriptions stay consistent
- **Runtime Updates**: Changes to metadata propagate to all chains

Example implementation:

```solidity
function updateTokenMetadata(
    string memory newName,
    string memory newSymbol
) external onlyOwner {
    _name = newName;
    _symbol = newSymbol;

    // Propagate to all connected chains
    for (uint i = 0; i < supportedChains.length; i++) {
        _sendMetadataUpdate(supportedChains[i]);
    }

    emit MetadataUpdated(newName, newSymbol);
}
```

### 3. Unified Token Governance

CCT tokens can implement governance that spans multiple chains:

- **Cross-Chain Voting**: Cast votes from any chain
- **Global Governance Actions**: Execute decisions across all deployments
- **Chain-Specific Parameters**: Set custom parameters per chain while maintaining core identity

## Technical Implementation Details

### Common Interface Extensions

CCT tokens extend standard token interfaces with cross-chain capabilities:

```solidity
interface ICCTToken is IERC20 {
    // Cross-chain transfer function
    function transferToChain(
        uint64 destinationChain,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (bytes32 transferId);

    // Receive tokens from another chain
    function receiveFromChain(
        uint64 sourceChain,
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata metadata
    ) external returns (bool);

    // Query information about supported chains
    function getSupportedChains() external view returns (uint64[] memory);

    // Get canonical token address on another chain
    function getRemoteTokenAddress(uint64 chainId) external view returns (bytes memory);

    // Events
    event SentToChain(
        uint64 indexed destinationChain,
        address indexed sender,
        address indexed recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32 transferId
    );

    event ReceivedFromChain(
        uint64 indexed sourceChain,
        address indexed sender,
        address indexed recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes32 transferId
    );
}
```

### Security Mechanisms

CCT implements multiple security layers:

1. **Attested Chain Registry**:

   - Each token maintains a registry of valid chains and their canonical token addresses
   - Only authorized chains can participate in cross-chain operations
   - Chain identifiers are cryptographically secure

2. **Transfer Verification**:

   - Each cross-chain transfer receives a unique identifier
   - Transfers can be verified on both source and destination chains
   - Replay protection prevents duplicate execution

3. **Supply Consistency Enforcement**:

   - Regular attestations verify global supply invariants
   - Automated reconciliation corrects supply divergence
   - Circuit breakers halt transfers if supply anomalies are detected

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Failed transfers can be recovered through governance actions
   - Emergency procedures handle extreme scenarios
   - Upgrade paths for addressing security vulnerabilities

## Cross-Chain Asset Model

CCT tokens implement one of several asset models:

### 1. Native Asset CCT

For blockchain native assets like ETH or MATIC:

- Wrapped representations on non-native chains
- Special handling for gas token mechanics
- Bridge reserves for backing transferred assets

### 2. Synthetic Asset CCT

For tokens that represent external assets (like stablecoins):

- Consistent peg mechanisms across chains
- Unified oracle price feeds
- Coordinated collateral management

### 3. Utility Token CCT

For application-specific tokens:

- Consistent utility across all deployments
- Synchronized staking and reward systems
- Unified tokenomics parameters

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Cross-Chain Transfer

```solidity
// On Ethereum chain - send tokens to Avalanche
function transferToAvalanche(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
    // 1. Verify the transfer is valid
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

    // 2. Burn or lock tokens on Ethereum
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);

    // 3. Generate transfer ID
    bytes32 transferId = keccak256(
        abi.encode(
            ETHEREUM_CHAIN_ID,
            AVALANCHE_CHAIN_ID,
            msg.sender,
            recipient,
            amount,
            nonces[msg.sender]++
        )
    );

    // 4. Emit event for bridge oracles to pick up
    emit SentToChain(
        AVALANCHE_CHAIN_ID,
        msg.sender,
        recipient,
        amount,
        transferId
    );

    // 5. Send message to Avalanche token contract
    messageBridge.sendMessage(
        AVALANCHE_CHAIN_ID,
        avalancheTokenAddress,
        abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "receiveFromChain(uint64,address,address,uint256,bytes32)",
            ETHEREUM_CHAIN_ID,
            msg.sender,
            recipient,
            amount,
            transferId
        )
    );
}

// On Avalanche chain - receive tokens from Ethereum
function receiveFromChain(
    uint64 sourceChain,
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 transferId
) external onlyBridge {
    // 1. Verify source chain is supported
    require(supportedChains[sourceChain], "Unsupported source chain");

    // 2. Verify transfer hasn't been processed
    require(!processedTransfers[transferId], "Transfer already processed");

    // 3. Mark transfer as processed
    processedTransfers[transferId] = true;

    // 4. Mint tokens to recipient
    _mint(recipient, amount);

    // 5. Emit receipt event
    emit ReceivedFromChain(
        sourceChain,
        sender,
        recipient,
        amount,
        transferId
    );
}
```

### Cross-Chain Governance

```solidity
// Submit a proposal that affects all chain deployments
function submitGlobalProposal(
    string calldata description,
    address[] calldata targets,
    uint256[] calldata values,
    bytes[] calldata calldatas
) external returns (uint256 proposalId) {
    // Create proposal on current chain
    proposalId = _createProposal(description, targets, values, calldatas);

    // Broadcast to all connected chains
    for (uint i = 0; i < supportedChains.length; i++) {
        uint64 chainId = supportedChains[i];
        if (chainId == LOCAL_CHAIN_ID) continue;

        messageBridge.sendMessage(
            chainId,
            getRemoteTokenAddress(chainId),
            abi.encodeWithSignature(
                "mirrorProposal(uint256,string,bytes)",
                proposalId,
                description,
                abi.encode(targets, values, calldatas)
            )
        );
    }

    emit GlobalProposalCreated(proposalId, msg.sender, description);
    return proposalId;
}
```

## Deployment and Bootstrapping

Launching a CCT token requires careful orchestration:

1. **Initial Deployment**:

   - Deploy on primary chain with total supply
   - Register the token in global CCT registry
   - Setup administrator/governance controls

2. **Secondary Chain Deployment**:

   - Deploy token contracts on secondary chains
   - Connect to bridge infrastructure
   - Register secondary contracts in primary contract

3. **Supply Allocation**:

   - Configure initial token distribution across chains
   - Set supply caps per chain if applicable
   - Initialize transfer limits

4. **Verification and Testing**:
   - Verify token behavior on all chains
   - Test cross-chain operations
   - Simulate recovery scenarios
